# GolfWebApp
This web application tracks scores and statistics of players at Old Hawthorne, a local golf course. This allows players to easily track scores overall and per hole right from their phone. This is done by with the user information, their scores, and course information kept in 3 different tables of a database. The app utilizes CRUD by creating new user data for registering users, reading user data after login and hole data for display in the 'Course Tour' section of the page, update to add new scores to the user, and delete when the old scores are overwritten.
