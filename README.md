Start with the about us page to introduce the people who worked on the project then move to the home page.

Introduce the homepage. Describe it as a simple tiled layout thats formatted for mobile and desktop. Target audience is for those who golf(older, less familiar with new technologies) so the interface was supposed to be easy and straight forward.

navigate to the course tour. discuss the layout of that page and how the tee off distances table is created by consulting the holes table on the SQL server.

finish with demonstrating the login screen and/or the create account option.
