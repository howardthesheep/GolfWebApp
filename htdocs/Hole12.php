	      	<p>The 12th hole is a mid-length par 3 playing slightly uphill from tee to green.   The green is nicely framed by two sizable trees and fronted by a sharp slope with a trio of bunkers resting at the foot of the slope.  It's all carry for the players from tee to green.  The green is deep with a sharp transition slope midway into the green creating an upper rear portion of the green.  An additional bunker sits back left of the green.  If players can carry their tee shot up over the front slope, there is fairway to the right of the green helping to create a bigger target area and giving the players a few more choices adjacent to the green.</p>
